# Portal - *Want You Gone* in Java
This program types out the lyrics similar to the credits screen during Portal 2. It even plays the audio for it! Sadly, it doesn't list the personnel that worked on it as I couldn't really figure out a good way to do that.
## How to install and run!
**You *MUST* have java installed** to do this!  
  
Download the files as a zip through GitHub. Then, extract the contents and open the folder you just extracted. Right click and select 'open in terminal'. Finally, run the command `java -jar want-you-gone.jar`. The terminal should clear, and the program will run! Hopefully.
